# generative_chatbot
A chatbot that can answer questions and do booking using natural language input.

UI is gradio because it is easy to integrate in a website.
Single page dummy fasthtml website will created and gradio project will be integrated.

For small model requests (the error message format, not main operations), it is possible to use Ollama and phi-3.5 to run on CPU but for ease free API request to Groq is preffered.
Also it can increase latency and might not do function calling.

create the room state and reservation system and connect them with llm
